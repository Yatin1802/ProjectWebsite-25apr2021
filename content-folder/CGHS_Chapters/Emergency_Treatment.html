				  <summary>Procedure for Emergency Treatment</summary>
				  <div class="content">
				   
				    	<p>
				    		CGHS beneficiaries have the option to go to a nearby Government hospital / empanelled private hospital or even any private hospital (including non empanelled), in case of emergency.  However, if treatment is undertaken at private non- empanelled hospitals under emergency, reimbursement will be limited to CGHS rates or actual, whichever may be lower. Since, non-empanelled private hospitals often charge at rates different from the CGHS rates there may be a difference in the amount reimbursed if the private hospital charges are higher than CGHS rates.

				  <summary>Credit Facility under Emergency</summary>
				  <div class="content">
				    <p>
				    	<ul class="chapter_ul">
				    		
				    		<li>1. CGHS empaneled hospitals cannot refuse admission in emergency to CGHS beneficiary and have to provide treatment on credit to pensioner beneficiaries and other entitled categories (even if the beneficiary is from outside CGHS city/other CGHS city).  </li>

				    		<li>2. The Treatment in casualty OPD is treated as Emergency and the beneficiary is eligible for the credit facility.</li>

				    		<li>3. Departments may also provide a letter to the concerned empanelled private hospital, through the beneficiaries, on certification by the concerned wellness centres/ nodal officers, or on the basis of emergency certificate issued by the hospital, to provide the necessary credit facility, subject to the condition that the bills will be cleared as per prevailing CGHS rules. </li>

				  </div>
				</details>

				<details class="style2">
				  <summary>Reimbursement of Emergency Bills.</summary>
				  <div class="content">
				    <p>
				      The bills may be submitted to the concerned department/ Wellness Centre with the detailed bills including breakup for room, laboratory, investigations, pharmacy etc. in duplicate. The bills must be supported by a valid Emergency Certificate issued by the concerned Private Hospital. 

				      In case the beneficiary availed treatment in the Emergency or Casualty OPD, and was discharged after preliminary treatment then the Emergency Certificate is not needed and the Casualty OPD slip is sufficient in such cases.

				  <summary>Medicines Purchased during Emergency </summary>
				  <div class="content">
				    
				    <p>
				    <ul class="chapter_ul">
				    	<li>
				    		The powers have been delegated to the Heads of the Ministries/ Departments and the Additional/Joint/Deputy Directors of the CGHS covered cities to reimburse the expenditure incurred by CGHS beneficiaries on purchase of medicines directly from authorized/registered chemist shops during emergency. 
				    	</li>
				    	<li>
				    		Since the term emergency will have a number of variants, it has been decided to leave the judgment to the Administrative Ministry (for serving beneficiaries) and the Additional/Joint/Deputy Director of the CGHS covered cities (for pensioners) to consider and decide the quantum of reimbursement for medicines and service provided/procured in such situation, provided hospitalization is not involved and for which separate provision exists.

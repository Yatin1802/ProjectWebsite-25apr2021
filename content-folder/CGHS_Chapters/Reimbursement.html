					    <ul class="a chapter_sub_para">
					    	<li>Claims preferred against treatment in Government hospitals/referral hospitals/recognised hospitals.</li>
					    	<li>Claims preferred against treatment in unrecognised private hospitals.</li>

					<p>
						<span class="chapter_sub_heading1">Claims of Government Hospitals/Referral Hospitals Recognised Hospitals</span>
						<p class="chapter_sub_para">
						The reimbursement for listed investigation and treatment is done as per the CGHS prescribed package rates. For the unlisted investigation, permission from CGHS/serving Department is necessary for reimbursement which is done as per the AIIMS rate or Actual whichever is lower. The claims should be preferred within 06 months of discharge or treatment. In case of investigation done or treatment taken from empanelled hospital/diagnostics centre, the reimbursement is admissible if the investigation or treatment is duly recommended or endorsed by the concerned Govt./ CGHS specialist. However, no permission or endorsement is required for the treatment taken from Centre/State Govt Hospital or hospitals under other Govt. Bodies.	
						</p>
						

						<span class="chapter_sub_heading1">Claims of Unrecognised Private Hospitals</span>
						<p class="chapter_sub_para">
							Central Government Health Scheme does not reimburse treatment taken from private unrecognised hospitals. However, in cases where treatment had to be taken in private unrecognised hospitals in an emergency, the claim are settled by the HoD of the Ministry/ Department subject to the ceiling of CGHS rates or AIIMS rates or Actuals whichever is lower.

				    <p>
					
				    The condonation of delay is not a routine matter as Government finances are involved. The bills should be submitted for reimbursement within 06 months of completion of treatment or discharge. In case there is delay in submission, the condonation of delay in submission of medical bills is decided by the Head of the Department (in case of serving beneficiaries) on the merits of each case. The HoD is free to reject the medical claims when they are not convinced of the reasons for the delay.

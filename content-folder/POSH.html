			<h2 style="font-weight:400; font-size: 1.4rem;">Prevention & Redressal of Sexual Harassment at Workplaces</h2>
			<p>With the increasing incidents of Sexual Harassment at Workplace, a need has been felt to raise awareness about this issue by providing brief and consolidated information on Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, 2013 and the remedies available under the Act as well as the initiatives, rules and guidelines issued by DoPT and M/o WCD from time to time.   </p>
			<br>
		
			<button class="accordion">About Sexual Harassment</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>Safe and secure workplace environment is right of every woman and it is the responsibility of the Employer to eliminate the workplace harassment of all forms. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect women’s right to equality of status and opportunity. </p>

			  <p>Though sexual harassment at the workplace has assumed serious proportions, women do not report the matter to the concerned authorities in most cases due to fear of reprisal from the harasser, being stigmatized, or losing professional standing and personal reputation. In many cases, women employees may face sexual harassment but they remain unaware that it is a breach of their rights and that there is something they can do about it. They need to know that they can do something about it. In order to change this order of things, it is necessary that measures are taken to change mind-sets and attitudes by creating awareness about what constitutes sexual harassment and the steps that can be taken to address it.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">What is Sexual Harassment at Workplace?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>“Sexual Harassment” includes anyone or more of the following unwelcome acts or behavior (whether directly or by implication), namely:

			  	<ul class="margin_for_list">
			  		<li>1. Physical contact or advances;</li>
			  		<li>2. A demand or request for sexual favors;</li>
			  		<li>3. Making sexually colored remarks;</li>
			  		<li>4. Showing pornography;</li>
			  		<li>5. Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature</li>
			  	</ul>

			  <p>
			  	Often the situations that start off innocently end up in inappropriate and unprofessional behaviors. It is important to remember that workplace sexual harassment is sexual, unwelcome and the experience is subjective. It is the impact and not the intent that matters. It is important also to remember that each case is unique and should be examined in its own context and according to the surrounding circumstances as a whole.

			<button class="accordion">Constitution of Internal Complaints Committee in the Workplace</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>

			  	The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, provides the redressal mechanism for harassment complaints by mandating the constitution of Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) through a written order by every Employer.  The ICC is to be composed of the following members:

			  	<table class="content_table">
			  		<th>Member</th>
			  		<th>Eligibility</th>
			  		<tr>
			  			<td>Chairperson</td>
			  			<td>Women working at senior level as employee; if not available then nominated from other Office/units/ department/ workplace of the same employer. As per DoP&T guidelines, Committee should be headed by an officer sufficiently higher in rank so as to lend credibility to the investigations.</td>
			  		</tr>

			  		<tr>
			  			<td>2 Members (minimum)</td>
			  			<td>From amongst employees  committed  to  the  cause  of  women/having legal knowledge/experience in social work</td>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  			<td>Member</td>
			  			<td>From amongst NGO/associations committed to the cause of women or a person familiar with the issue of Sexual Harassment</td>
			  		</tr>
			  	</table>

			  	<p class="bold_sub_heading">Time limit for filing harassment complaint and what should it contain?
			  	</p>
			  	<p>
				  	Any aggrieved woman  may make, in writing, a complaint of sexual harassment at workplace to the Internal Committee within  a  period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of  incident  and  in  case  of  a series of incidents, within a period of three months from the date of last incident. The Complaints Committee may, however, extend the time limit for reasons to be recorded in writing, if it is satisfied that the circumstances were such which prevented the complainant from filing a complaint within the stipulated period.

				  	The written complaint should contain a description of each incident(s). It should include relevant dates, timings and locations; name of the respondent(s); and the working relationship between the parties. A person designated to manage the workplace sexual harassment complaint is required to provide assistance in writing of the complaint if the complainant seeks it for any reason.

					</ul>
				
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>During a redress process the Complaints Committee is required to assure confidentiality, non-retaliation and recommend interim measures as needed to conduct a fair inquiry.</p>
			</div>

				<button class="accordion">Formal & Informal Mechanisms of Redressals</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p>
				  	For the redressal of the complaint, two options are available to the Complainant – Formal mechanism and Informal mechanism. 

				  	<p class="bold_sub_heading">Informal Mechanism (Conciliation)</p>
						
					<p>
						The Internal  Committee  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  Local  Committee,  may, before initiating an inquiry under section 11 and at the request of the aggrieved woman take steps to settle the matter between her and the respondent through conciliation. Provided that no monetary settlement shall be made as a basis of conciliation. 
						However, before  recommending  conciliation,  the  Committee  must  assess  the  severity  of  the  situation and if necessary, advise and enable the complainant to opt for the formal route. At no point, the Complaints Committee will advise the complainant to resolve the matter directly with the respondent. Where such an informal process is successful, such resolution is to be recorded by  the  conciliator  and    forwarded  to  the  ICC which in  turn  will  forward  the  same  to  the  employer for further action based on the resolution.
						The  choice  of  a  formal  process  rests  with  the  complainant  even  if  the  person  responsible  for managing the complaint believes that this can be resolved through an informal process.
					</p>

					<p class="bold_sub_heading">Formal Mechanism</p>
					
					<p>If the complainant opts for formal redress, or the nature of the complaint is serious which calls for formal redress, then the Complaints Committee responds to the complaint. Within seven days of receiving a complaint, the Complaints Committee will inform the respondent in writing that a complaint has been received. The respondent will have an opportunity to respond to the complaint in writing within ten days thereafter.</p>
					
					<p class="bold_sub_heading">Interim Relief to the Complainant</p>
					<p>
						The Committee will have the powers to recommend: -
						<ul style="padding-left: 1em;">
							<li>(a) To transfer the aggrieved woman or the charged officer to any other workplace; or</li>
							<li>(b) To grant leave to the aggrieved woman up to a period of three months. (The leave will not be deducted from her leave account.)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					The Complaints Committee set up in each Ministry or Department etc. for inquiring into such complaints are deemed to be the Inquiring Authority appointed by the Disciplinary Authority for the purpose of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. The Complaints Committee, unless a separate procedure has been prescribed, shall hold the inquiry as far as practicable in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules. 

					<p class="bold_sub_heading">Report of the Internal Committee</p>
					
					<p>An inquiry must be completed within 90 days and a final report submitted to the Employer or District Officer (as the case may be) within ten days thereafter. Such report will also be made available to the concerned parties. The Employer or District Officer is obliged to act on the  recommendations within 60 days. Any person not satisfied with the findings or recommendations  of the Complaints Committee or non-implementation of the recommendations, may appeal in an  appropriate court or tribunal, as prescribed under the Service Rules. 

					It is important that the complaints  by  women  be  treated  fairly  and  not  dismissed. The  mere  inability  to  substantiate  a complaint  or  provide  adequate  proof  will  not  attract  legal  action  against  the  complainant. However, making a false or malicious complaint or producing a forged or misleading document is an  offence.</p>
					

			  	</p>

			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Dual Role of the ICC and the Inquiry Process</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  
			  <p class="bold_sub_heading">Two Stage involvement of ICC</p>
			  <p>
			  	<p>
			  		The Complaints Committee is normally involved at two Stages.  The first stage is when the Committee conducts the preliminary investigations on receipt of a complaint. The facts of the allegation are required to be verified. This is called preliminary enquiry/fact finding enquiry or investigation. They may then try to ascertain the truth of the allegations by collecting the documentary evidence as well as recording statements of any possible witnesses including the complainant. If it becomes necessary to issue a Charge Sheet, disciplinary authority relies on the investigation for drafting the imputations, as well as for evidence by which the charges are to be proved. Therefore this is a very important part of the investigation.
			  	</p>

			  	<p>
			  		The second stage is when they act as Inquiring Authority. It is necessary that the two roles are clearly understood and the inquiry is conducted as far as practicable as per Rule 14 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. Failure to observe the procedure may result in the inquiry getting vitiated. As the Complaints Committees also act as Inquiring Authority in terms of Rule 14(2) mentioned above, care has to be taken that at the investigation stage that impartiality is maintained. Any failure on this account may invite allegations of bias when conducting the inquiry and may result in the inquiry getting vitiated. As per the instructions, when allegations of bias are received against an Inquiring Authority, such Inquiring Authority is required to stay the inquiry till the Disciplinary Authority takes a decision on the allegations of bias. Further, if allegations of bias are established against one member of the Committee on this basis, that Committee may not be allowed to conduct the inquiry.
			  	</p>

			  </p>

			  <p class="bold_sub_heading">Decision on Charge-Sheet by Disciplinary Authority</p>
			  <p>

			  	<p>
			  		On receipt of the Investigation Report, the Disciplinary Authority should examine the report with a view to see as to whether a formal Charge Sheet needs to be issued to the Charged Officer. As per Rule 14(3), Charge Sheet is to be drawn by or on behalf of the Disciplinary Authority. In case the Disciplinary Authority decides on that course, the Charged Officer should be given an opportunity of replying to the Charge sheet. As per Rule 14(5), a decision on conducting the inquiry has to be taken after consideration of the reply of the charged officer.
			  	</p>
			  	 
				<p>
					If the Charged Officer admits the charges clearly and unconditionally, there will be no need for a formal inquiry against him and further action may be taken as per Rule 15 of the CCS (CCA) Rules.
				</p>
				 
				<p>
					In case the Charged Officer denies the charges and his reply is not convincing, the Charge sheet along with his reply may be sent to the Complaints Committee for formal inquiry, and documents mentioned in Rule 14 (6) will be forwarded to the Complaints Committee which acts as an Inquiry Authority as per Rule 14 of CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 and prepares the Inquiry Report. 
				</p>
				

			  </p>

			  <p class="bold_sub_heading">Recommendation by Inquiry Authority</p>
			  <p>
			  	Normally, the Inquiry Officer is not allowed to make any recommendations in his report. Here the function of the Complaints Committee acting as the Inquiring Authority differs. The Complaints Committee may however, make recommendations as under:

			  	<ul>
			  		<li>(a) To grant such other relief to the aggrieved woman as may be prescribed; or</li>
			  		<li>(b) To deduct from the salary or wages of the charged officer such sum as it may consider appropriate to be paid to the aggrieved woman or to her legal heirs.</li>
			  		<li>(c) Any amount outstanding at the time of cessation of the services of the charged officer due to retirement, death or otherwise may be recovered from the terminal benefits payable to the officer or his heirs</li>
			  		<li>(d) Such compensation will not amount to penalty under Rule 11 of CCS (CCA) Rules.</li>
			  		<li>(e) The Committee may recommend action to be taken against complainant, if the allegation is malicious, or the complainant knows it to be false, or has produced any forged or misleading document.</li>
			  		<li>(f) The Committee may also recommend action against any witness if such witness has given false evidence or produced any forged or misleading document.</li>
			  		<li></li>

			  	</ul>			

			  </p>

			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Special provisions to deal with threats or intimidation</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>
			  	
			  	The Disciplinary Authority may also dispense with inquiry under Rule 19(ii), and action may be taken without the inquiry when the Disciplinary Authority concludes that it is not reasonably practicable to hold such an inquiry. The circumstances leading to such a conclusion may exist either before the inquiry is commenced or may develop in the course of the inquiry. Such situation would be deemed to have arisen:

			  	<ul style="padding-left:1em;">
			  		<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">i) Where the Government servant, through or together with his associates terrorizes, threatens or intimidates witnesses who are likely to give evidence against him with fear of reprisal in order to prevent them from doing so; or</li>

			  		<li>ii) Where the Government servant himself or with or through others threatens, intimidates and terrorizes the Disciplinary Authority, Members of the Committee, the Presenting Officer or members of their family.</li>

			  	</ul>
			
			  </p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Appeal by the Complainant if no action is recommended by the Committee</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>
			  	Where a Complaint Committee has not recommended any action against the  employee against whom the allegation have been made in a case involving  allegations of sexual harassment, the Disciplinary Authority shall supply a copy of the Report of the Complaint Committee to the complainant and shall consider her representation, if any submitted, before coming to a final conclusion. The  representation shall be deemed to be an appeal under section 18(i) of the Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.
